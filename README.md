Access Control Worksheet
Notes (about the user):

The event log indicates that the IP address used during the incident does not match the typical IP addresses listed for current employees.
The access occurred outside regular working hours, which is unusual behavior for legitimate business operations.
Issues (access control):

All employees currently use a shared cloud drive, which lacks individual access permissions, making it difficult to track or limit access to sensitive files.
No role-based access controls are in place, allowing employees access to resources beyond what their roles require.
Recommendations (mitigations):

Implement role-based access controls (RBAC): Restrict access to files and resources based on the user's specific role and responsibilities, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel.
Set up individual accounts with unique credentials: Eliminate the shared cloud drive for managing company resources and ensure each employee has a personal account with limited access. This improves accountability and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
